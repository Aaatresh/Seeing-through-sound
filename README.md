# Overview
Here, we explore two algorithms that can be used to help the visually impaired see indirectly through sound: image captioning vs vOICe algorithm.

# Data
The image that is to be described must be fed into the system. To train the "show and tell" model, a large dataset of images and their corresponding captions would be required, and these can be stored in a directory before training.
