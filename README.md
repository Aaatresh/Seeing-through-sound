## Description
Here, we explore two algorithms that can be used to help the visually impaired see indirectly through sound: image captioning vs vOICe algorithm.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
* ex. Windows 10

### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Data
The image that is to be described must be fed into the system. To train the "show and tell" model, a large dataset of images and their corresponding captions would be required, and these can be stored in a directory before training.

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
```
code blocks for commands
```
